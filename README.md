Assignment Description: This project is to create the abstract data type (ADT) for a polynomial called Poly. 
 
Implement  the  internal  representation  of  a  polynomial  (nonnegative  exponents)  as  an  array  of  
terms.  One  array  is  sufficient  to  store  one  polynomial.  One  term  is  stored  in  one  array  element;  
each term contains an exponent and a coefficient. The array element subscript is the exponent and 
the content of the element is the coefficient value. A constructor receives at most two values, the 
coefficient  of  the  term  and  the  largest  exponent  currently  expected.  (The  coefficient  may  be  
changed later using functions.) Dynamically allocate initial memory for your array using only as 
many  elements  as  needed.  (After  the  Poly  object  instantiation,  the  size  of  the  array  need  not  be  
tied  to  the  largest  exponent.  i.e.,  you  may  want  to  make  the  array  larger  when  needed,  but  
typically an array is not made smaller as it is inefficient.) 
 
Develop a full class: 
1. All proper constructor and destructor functions, e.g., 
Poly A(5,7);  // Memory is reserved for polynomial A, with a largest power of 7  
// and the coefficient is set to 5: +5x^7.  
Poly B(2);          // B has one element, initialized to +2x^0 
Poly X;                      // Initialized to 0x^0 (zero polynomial) 
Poly C(A);                 // C is an exact copy (deep copy) of A. 
 
To make sure you understand memory, when Poly A is +5x^7 -4x^3 +10x -2 memory for the 
object A looks like 
  
2. Overload common operators: 
(a). The addition, subtraction, and multiplication operators (+, -, *) to add, subtract, multiply two 
polynomials 
(b). The assignment operator (=) to assign one polynomial to another 
(c). The addition, subtraction, multiplication assignment operators (+=, -=, *=) 
(d). The equality and inequality operators (==, !=) 
 
3. Accessors: 
(a). Overload << to output an entire polynomial, print “ +5x^3 -2x^2 +4” to represent the Poly 
5 x cubed minus 2 x squared plus 4. Use the following exact formatting. Must-do rules for 
displaying polynomials: 
 Use lowercase x 
Page 2 of 3 
 
 A nonzero coefficient and its sign are always displayed (display exactly one blank before 
every sign) 
 Do not display a new line in operator<< at the end of the polynomial 
 Do not display extra blanks at the end or anywhere else in the polynomial 
 A power of 1 is not displayed and x is not shown at all for a power of 0, e.g., +1x^4 +2x -
10 
 Don't print a term if the coefficient is zero, except if all the coefficients are zero, then 
print " 0" 
(b). Get one term's coefficient, called getCoeff, e.g., 
int coeff = P.getCoeff(2); 
cout << "coeff of power 2 of P is: " << coeff << endl; 
 
4. Mutators: 
(a). Overload >> to input all coeffs (sets all terms of one Poly, in a loop; it is expected that a user 
enters one coefficient and an exponent repeatedly, Enters -1 for both when done; no data type-
checking). e.g.,  
to set A, Poly A(2,7); so that A is +5x^7 -4x^3 +10x –2 
the user enters the pairs in any order: 5 7 10 1 -4 3 -2 0 -1 -1 on one line or 
multiple lines. 
 
(b). Set one coefficient, called setCoeff, e.g.,  
P.setCoeff(50,0); // set x^0 coeff to 50 
 
Miscellaneous Rules  
 Test  your  code  thoroughly.  You  may  find  lab1.cpp  file  on  canvas  to  help  clarify  the  
functional requirements. HOWEVER, it doesn't thoroughly test your Poly class. We will 
run our own main to test your code.    
 Use valgrind often to find memory leaks (as you develop).  
 You must handle errors such as trying to access a non-existent term. All operations must 
work  correctly  and  not  crash  under  any  circumstances,  so  thoroughly  test  your  
program. Do NOT print error messages; deal with errors appropriately. For example, for 
the coefficient of a non-existent term, you could return zero.   
 You do NOT need to handle data type errors, e.g., entering a char instead of int. You are 
NOT allowed to use anything from the STL or 342’s Array class. You may not fix the 
array  size  at  some  large  constant.  The  point  of  this  assignment  is  to  review  memory  
management; you will be allocating/deallocating memory often.  
 Do  NOT  discuss  implementation  (arrays)  on  Canvas.  Any  questions  having  to  do  with  
arrays  come  to  only  me.  Any  questions  posted  on  Canvas  would  have  to  do  with  the  
polynomial ADT. Of course, you can always discuss class related stuff, software, etc.   
 If  your  program  does  not  compile  with  the  sample  main  given,  you  will  receive  a  
maximum of 50% of the points. It will not be fixed! Note that this sample main typically 
does not test your program thoroughly.    
 NEVER make us enter characters at the terminal. Remove all "cin >> ..." or 
system("pause") from your code before you turn it in.  
 
 
Submission Requirements: 
Page 3 of 3 
 
The  softcopy  of  well-commented  code  (.cpp,  .h)  needed  to  be  submitted  to  Canvas  by  the  due  
time. You may optionally submit a typescript file to record your program in action (this is often 
helpful in resolving possible grading discrepancy).  
 
Though you may develop and test your code using any compiler, any IDE, you will electronically 
turn in your code from the linux machines in UW1-320. See Linux guide on Canvas (Pages/For 
Assignments) for directions on how to do this. 
 
As  always  expected  when  programming,  comment  clearly  and  thoroughly.  Clearly  state  any  
assumptions  you  make  in  the  beginning  comment  block  of  the  appropriate  place,  e.g.,  the  class  
definition.  Comments  in  the  class  definition  file  should  describe  the  ADT,  all  functionality,  and  
assumptions.  Pre  and  post  conditions  are  recommended,  but  not  required.  Functions  in  the  .cpp  
file must be separated using comment separator lines. See from the 342 sample code 
(http://courses.washington.edu/css342/zander/code.html) the Array class for an example of 
commenting and separator lines (in .cpp file).  
 
Evaluation Criteria: - 100 points
